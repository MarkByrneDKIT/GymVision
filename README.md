  AI ASSISTED WEIGHTLIFTING TRACKER

  People who start working out initially have it hard getting used to new lifts and the correct way of doing these lifts. Our app is being created with these people in   mind, to assist them in their journey in the gym. Starting out with three basic lifts (shoulder press, deadlift, squat). The user will be more inclined to use it at    a home gym/ private gym.

  We use computer vision with two webcams to process the user's body movements, which allows us to calculate the amount of reps and sets the user has done. Along with    this we can "guide" the user on their form i.e., we will warn them if they are tilting too much or have the weight in the wrong position. The data (reps, sets,       warning message and tilt) is then sent to our website where it can be viewed live.

  A history system is in place which allows users to view their data from previous sessions i.e., the message saying their form is bad and at which rep/set, to review    their progress over each session.
